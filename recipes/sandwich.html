    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This jalapeño popper grilled cheese is an awesome spin on a plain grilled cheese sandwich. Feel free to 
        alter it to your liking. The ciabatta bread is not typical grilled cheese material but the crunch of the
        buttery grilled chewy bread goes perfectly with this jalapeño filling. You can also use sourdough bread.</p>
    <h4>Sandwich ingredeints:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sour cream</li>
        <li>10 pickled jalapeno pepper slices, or to taste - chopped</li>
        <li>2 ciabatta sandwich rolls</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons butter</li>
        <li>8 tortilla chips, crushed</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine cream cheese, sour cream, and pickled jalapeno in a small bowl. Set aside. Preheat a skillet 
            over medium heat. </li>
        <li>Slice each roll in half horizontally, then slice the rounded tops off the ciabatta rolls to make a 
            flat top half. Spread 1 teaspoon butter on the doughy cut side of the bottom bun and 1 teaspoon butter 
            on the now flattened top bun. Place 1/2 of the cream cheese mixture, 1/2 of the crushed chips, and 1/2 
            of the shredded cheese on the non-buttered side of the bottom bun. Place the top half of the bun on the 
            sandwich and place the sandwich on the hot skillet. Repeat with the second sandwich. </li>
        <li>Grill until lightly browned and flip over, about 3 to 5 minutes; continue grilling until cheese is melted and the
             second side is golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
